# Knee MRI Bones segmentation by Deep Learning

This project is the segmentation of knee bones on MRI images using a U-net network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Data

The original dataset is from [SKI10 contest](http://www.ski10.org/) - It is composed of 100 MRIs and their corresponding segmentations. I am not allowed to upload the dataset. Check their [website](http://www.ski10.org/) to download the full dataset.
